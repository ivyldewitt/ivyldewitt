### Welcome

I'm Ivy DeWitt, a data analyst with 8+ years of background in integration engineering, technical support and implementation management. 

Feel free to ask me about data governance and security. My passions is to learn how the massive amounts of data being created every moment can be processed in a secure and compliant way. I strongly believe that every corporation, government, or other entity that deals with data must move past passively consuming and using data for their own purposes, but responsibly manage and process that data. 

The process of taking in information and data and synthesizing it into a cohesive whole, whether that's working with others to devise project plans for a data delivery, composing technical documentation to share within my company, or training users on how to best understand a product and it's workflows fascinates me. 

To expand my knowledge and further grow as a data analyst, I am pursuing a graduate degree in data science at the University of Berkeley, expected graduation in December 2024.
